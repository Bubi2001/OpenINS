* **üíª Submitting Code or Hardware Changes:** If you want to fix a bug or implement a new feature, you can do so through a pull request.

## Your First Contribution (Pull Request Guide)

Ready to submit a change? Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to making your first contribution.

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/Bubi2001/OpenINS.git`
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes. Please use a descriptive name.

    ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
    ```

4. **Make your changes!** Whether you're editing KiCad files, C code for the firmware, or documentation, this is your time to shine.
5. **Follow the Style Guides** (see below). If you've made code changes, please format your code before committing.
6. **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add support for a new barometer sensor"
    ```

7. **Push your changes** to your fork on GitHub.

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-new-feature
    ```

8. **Open a Pull Request** from your branch to the `main` branch of the original OpenINS repository. Provide a clear title and a detailed description of the changes you've made.

## Pull Request Process

Once you've submitted a pull request, a few things will happen:

1. **CI Checks:** Our GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run. It will check code formatting, build the firmware, and run hardware checks. Your pull request must pass all these checks.
2. **Code Review:** A maintainer will review your changes. We may ask for modifications or provide feedback.
3. **Merge:** Once your pull request is approved and all checks have passed, a maintainer will merge it into the main codebase. Congratulations! üéâ
