> OpenINS is an open-source Inertial Navigation System (INS) project that serves as a complete reference guide for designing and building your own high-performance sensor fusion platform. This repository documents the entire engineering process, from advanced RF PCB design and simulation to firmware development and physical verification.

The design focuses on the implementation of the RF design to add an active antena (via u.FL connector) for the GPS module and a Meandered Inverted-F Antenna (MIFA) for the wireless communications. The firmware on the RP2354B will be implemented using its official SDK and the goal is to perform an Extended Kalman Filter to fuse data from all the sensors to get accurate inertial navigation data. The firmware on the ESP32C6 will be implemented using ESP-IDF and the goal is to communicate wirelessly the fused data.

## üî¨ Simulation and Verification

This project emphasizes the importance of validating design choices.

- The `simulations/` folder contains the scripts and files used to model the RF performance before manufacturing.
- The `physical_verification/` folder contains exported data from lab equipment, showing how the real-world hardware compares to the simulations.
