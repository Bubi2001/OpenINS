This repository documents the entire engineering process, from advanced RF PCB design and simulation to firmware development and physical verification.</p> <p>The design focuses on the implementation of the RF design to add an active antena (via u.FL connector) for the GPS module and a Meandered Inverted-F Antenna (MIFA) for the wireless communications. The firmware on the RP2354B will be implemented using its official SDK and the goal is to perform an Extended Kalman Filter to fuse data from all the sensors to get accurate inertial navigation data. The firmware on the ESP32C6 will be implemented using ESP-IDF and the goal is to communicate wirelessly the fused data.</p>"},{"location":"#key-features","title":"\ud83c\udf1f Key Features","text":"<p>-Hardware:</p> <ul> <li>Custom 4-layer PCB designed in KiCAD.</li> <li>Impedance-controlled trace for the GPS active antenna.</li> <li>Integrated Bias-T circuit to power the external LNA of the GPS antenna.</li> <li>On-board impedance-matched trace antenna for the ESP32's Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.</li> <li>Careful component placement and layout for optimal signal integrity.</li> <li>Contains a NEO M9N GPS module.</li> <li>Contains a xx Inertial Measurement Unit.</li> <li>Contains a xx Barometer.</li> <li>Contains a RP2354B for Sensor Fusion algorithms</li> <li>Contains a ESP32C6 for Wireless Communication</li> </ul> <p>-Firmware:</p> <ul> <li>Powered by an ESP32-S3/C6 for high performance and wireless connectivity.</li> <li>Advanced sensor fusion using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).</li> <li>Modular software architecture using the <code>pl\u00e0nols</code> repository as a git submodule for core drivers and math libraries.</li> <li>Wireless data streaming of fused orientation and position data.</li> </ul> <p>-Complete Workflow:</p> <ul> <li>RF sections (antennas, filters) simulated using OpenEMS and Octave.</li> <li>Real-world performance validated with a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and spectrum analyzer.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#system-block-diagram","title":"\u2699\ufe0f System Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"#getting-started","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Getting Started","text":"<p>Follow these steps to replicate the project.</p>"},{"location":"#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>-Software: KiCAD (v9.0+), Visual Studio Code IDE with <code>Raspberry Pi Pico</code> and <code>ESP-IDF</code> extensions, OpenEMS, Octave, Python.</p> <p>-Hardware: See the Bill of Materials (BOM) in the <code>hardware/manufacturing/</code> folder.</p>"},{"location":"#hardware-assembly","title":"Hardware Assembly","text":"<ol> <li>Generate the Gerbers from the KiCAD project located in <code>hardware/kicad/</code>.</li> <li>Order the PCB from your preferred manufacturer.</li> <li>Source the components listed in the BOM.</li> <li>Solder the components to the PCB.

Depending on the severity of a violation, lower rungs on the ladder may be skipped.</p> <p>1) Warning    1) Event: A violation involving a single incident or series of incidents.    2) Consequence: A private, written warning from the Community Moderators.    3) Repair: Examples of repair include a private written apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and seeking clarification on expectations. 2) Temporarily Limited Activities    1) Event: A repeated incidence of a violation that previously resulted in a warning, or the first incidence of a more serious violation.    2) Consequence: A private, written warning with a time-limited cooldown period designed to underscore the seriousness of the situation and give the community members involved time to process the incident. The cooldown period may be limited to particular communication channels or interactions with particular community members.    3) Repair: Examples of repair may include making an apology, using the cooldown period to reflect on actions and impact, and being thoughtful about re-entering community spaces after the period is over. 3) Temporary Suspension    1) Event: A pattern of repeated violation which the Community Moderators have tried to address with warnings, or a single serious violation.    2) Consequence: A private written warning with conditions for return from suspension. In general, temporary suspensions give the person being suspended time to reflect upon their behavior and possible corrective actions.    3) Repair: Examples of repair include respecting the spirit of the suspension, meeting the specified conditions for return, and being thoughtful about how to reintegrate with the community when the suspension is lifted. 4) Permanent Ban    1) Event: A pattern of repeated code of conduct violations that other steps on the ladder have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that the Community Moderators determine there is no way to keep the community safe with this person as a member.    2) Consequence: Access to all community spaces, tools, and communication channels is removed. In general, permanent bans should be rarely used, should have strong reasoning behind them, and should only be resorted to if working through other remedies has failed to change the behavior.    3) Repair: There is no possible repair in cases of this severity.</p> <p>This enforcement ladder is intended as a guideline.
